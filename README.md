This custom theme was originally derived from Zen theme's 8.x development version, but diverged quite a bit as that original theme stalled and the client's theme evolved. Includes a fully componentized atomic design (see [project_s.libraries.yml](project_s/project_s.libraries.yml) and the [components directory](project_s/components/)) with a [generated KSS styleguide](project_s/styleguide/) (see rendered [Section A](https://rootwork.github.io/code-demo/project_s/styleguide/section-scorecards.html) and [Section B](https://rootwork.github.io/code-demo/project_s/styleguide/section-slm.html) for examples).
