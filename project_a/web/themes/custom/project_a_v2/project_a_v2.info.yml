# The "libraries-extend:" section will allow you to add your own JS or CSS to
# existing libraries.
# libraries-extend:

# The "libraries:" section will add a library to ALL pages. The contents of
# these libraries are defined in `project_a_v2.libraries.yml`.
#
# Use attach_library() for all component styles. This ensures that these
# libraries are only included when these components are used, instead of
# on every page.
#
# Note you should duplicate any new library declarations that apply to the body
# area in the `ckeditor_stylesheets` section further down.
libraries:
  - project_a_v2/global

# ### CKEDITOR ### #
# CKEditor stylesheet. This can be a separate stylesheet, but it's best practice
# to simply provide the main stylesheet and then add CKEditor editing area
# overrides as necessary. Note not every stylesheet needs to be added here, only
# those that would be needed in the main content area of a page or article.
ckeditor_stylesheets:
  - assets/css/project_a.css
  # CKEditor overrides should always come last.
  - assets/css/ckeditor.css

# ### COMPONENTS ### #
# Component mapping. This is used by the contrib module Component Libraries to
# reference .twig files in the `sass` directory by using the Twig namespace:
# @pl
