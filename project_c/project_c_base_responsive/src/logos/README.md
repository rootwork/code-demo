# Logo source files

These are the source files for the SVG (vector) versions of Project_c and PROJECT_C web logos.

`75-white.gif` and `PROJECT_C.gif` were sourced from the [Project_c Brand Book][1] [Logo Banner Tool][2] as references.

`CULogo-red120px.eps`, from the brand book download page, was used for the Project_c logo.

The `.gif` reference files were used in the Inkscape illustration program to size and place the Project_c logo and the text (including some custom letter spacing to match the images).

As per the brand book, the red color is `#b31b1b` and the typeface is Palatino
